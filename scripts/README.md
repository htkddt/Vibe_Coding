# Scripts

## Purpose

This directory will contain repeatable automation for development, validation, CI, and release operations. Scripts are grouped by the component they support.

## Structure

~~~text
scripts/
├── backend/
├── chatbot/
├── database/
└── frontend/
~~~

## Plan

1. Add environment validation and dependency-install helpers.
2. Add component-specific lint, build, test, and local-run scripts.
3. Add database migration and backup automation when persistence is introduced.
4. Add CI entry-point scripts that invoke tests exclusively from `../tests/`.
5. Document required inputs, expected output, permissions, and rollback behavior for every automation script.

## Conventions

- Use English names and lowercase kebab-case filenames.
- Prefer PowerShell for Windows-first local workflows; use Node.js or Python when portability requires it.
- Scripts must be idempotent where practical and must not embed secrets.

## Documentation Rule

Update this README and the matching component README whenever an automation changes a component workflow. Update the root README when it changes project-wide operations.
